###### Apparmor Profiles Collection
*I wanted to publish apparmor profiles I use, long time ago. But was scared it will decrease security level for me.
Most profiles you can find here are default Ubuntu apparmor profiles. Some are modified profiles, and some based on another 3-rd party profiles and some created from scratch.
I want this repository to became a place where people can share there own profiles and link profiles from another sources here too.
Basically, some profiles needs modifications for your needs. I want this repository to became a good place to start, when you creating profile for yourself.  
Its much easier when you have another profile to base on. Most profiles use abstractions here, and this makes profiles writing even easier. Pull requests, are welcome here!*
**Let's make apparmor profiles creation easier together. Its time to take back control on things in your own hands!**
